# My Python Logging Setup

A toy codebase illustrating native python logging functionality.

Goals:

- unified logger formatting

- dynamic logger formatting (easy to set and reset format, and done safely)

- function decorator (logs function calls, inputs and outputs)

- class decorator (logs instantiations and method calls)

- section timer
